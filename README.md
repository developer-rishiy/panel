# DiveDeck Panel

## Overview
An open source project powered by Docker for managing applications, game servers and more. Ditch Pterodactyl , Pelican or PufferPanel and fly higher with a panel that isn't named after a creature.

> [!WARNING]
> DiveDeck is not ready for production use, nor does it have a stable and completed release yet.

## Configuration
Edit the `config.json` file in the root directory to set up the application settings including the database connection and port.

## Usage
Navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` to access the DiveDeck Panel. Log in with your user credentials to manage and view instances.
